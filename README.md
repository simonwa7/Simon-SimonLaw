This repository contains the files to create the website located at clevelanddivorce.net and was created by me - William Simon!

The lawyers at the Law Offices of Simon&Simon (my father and cousin) focus on family law and class action lawsuits. 

If you need a lawyer, there are none better!

This site was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend simply uses node.js and express. The basis of the site comes from a template created by Colorlib!
